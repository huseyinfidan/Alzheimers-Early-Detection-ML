# Alzheimer's Disease Early Detection Project 🧠

This project focuses on the early detection of Alzheimer's Disease using Machine Learning algorithms. We analyzed clinical and demographic data from 2,149 patients to predict disease presence using Python.

## 🏆 Key Results
Our comparative analysis shows that **Gradient Boosting** is the most effective model for this task.

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| **Gradient Boosting** | **95.81%** 🚀 |
| Random Forest | 92.50% |
| Logistic Regression | 85.20% |
